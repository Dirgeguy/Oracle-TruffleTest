# Oracle-TruffleTest
This will be a repository for a oracle building and testing tutorial by  John R. Kosinski.

### Main Intent

This will be a back up for the code provided by Mr. Kosinski and the changes I have made to allow for compatability after several changes made by the required tools. Code will be written in Solidity for smart contracts and Javascript for Truffle/Ganache testing/scripting.


### Files

The smart contracts will build a prototype Boxing betting contract which function autonomously. The betting contract will receive all its information from a oracle which will provide the needed connection to off-chain resources and information.


### Configuration
all configuration files are currently set to my private ganache test chain. Although the network connection points are default for any ganache chain, and the inbuilt Truffle develop chain still functions as default as well.
